# idesk - a largely underrated tool

idesk is a dead project because - in my opinion - reached a status of "good 
enough". I think it has quite a lot of features for a tiny program. Randomly:

- supports png icons
- each icon can run almost whatever you want
- you can mix small and (very) big icons
- supports tooltips
- can launch 2 (more? ... never tried) different commands from the same icon

and others you can discover reading the example config or the man page.

I think it suffers for the lack of a good example setup. Once installed you
need to do some manual configuration, plus the default example 'lnk' file is
accompanied by a bit sad xpm icon :-/

That's why i created a script and a kind of 'configuration file' that you can
find inside the icons directory (see doicons.sh and allicons.txt).
